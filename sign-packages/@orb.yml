  Sign RPM and Debian Package in CircleCI.

  For any signing to work, we rely on the `allow-loopback-pinentry` feature
  of GnuPG, which was introduced in GnuPG 2.1.
  For RPM package signing, you must have the `rpm-sign` utility installed.
  For Debian package signing, you must have the `debsigs` utility installed.

  Note: Before you can use the `sign-packages` orb, you must first add
  CircleCI environment variables to your build.

  GPG_SECRET_KEY:

    Create the `GPG_SECRET_KEY` variable with the output of this command:
    gpg --export-secret-key <your-key-id> | base64

  GPG_PASSPHRASE:

    Create the `GPG_PASSPHRASE` variable by running `base64` with no
    arguments, then typing your GPG pass phrase, and when you're done
    hit `CTRL+D`.  This avoids putting your pass phrase into your
    shell command history.

    If your GPG key does not have a pass phrase, this variable is
    optional.
