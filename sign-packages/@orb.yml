  Utilities for simplifying CircleCI workflows from OpenNMS.

  For any signing to work, we rely on the `allow-loopback-pinentry` feature
  of GnuPG, which was introduced in GnuPG 2.1.
  For RPM package signing, you must have the `rpm-sign` utility installed.
  For Debian package signing, you must have the `debsigs` utility installed.
